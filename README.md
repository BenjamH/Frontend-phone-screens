# Frontend Phone Screens

**All questions in this repo have been received by friends applying for frontend roles in the Bay Area -- 10/1/16 to present** 

There you are, at your computer on a technical phone screen for a company you would LOVE to work for. The interviewer asks you to "center a div, vertically", so that you can get "warmed up". Uh oh...you draw a blank, and realize you can't google the syntax for your first idea. The interviewer waits for a moment, and then says: "You said you're a front end developer, right...?"

These are the situations we'll be working to avoid!. We know you could easily complete any of the challenges in this repo with the help of google and a little time, but your goal is to be able to pass these with ease so you can get to the onsite interviews. A great way to accomplish that is through exposure to new problems, and repetition. Any prompt added to this repo has been used in a real interview within the last 6 months. Enjoy!

## CSS
CSS questions that are often used in phone screens for front-end positions.

### 1) Hamburger Menu

You're given a div with a class name "hamburger". Create the hamburger menu icon (3 horizontal lines). You have 10 minutes...go! Note: there are quite a few ways to accomplish this.

Here's a codepen where you can give it a shot: http://codepen.io/quinkinser/pen/BQNWmm

Stuck?
Here are some ideas:
- Have you ever made pseudo-elements in CSS?
- Have you heard of the "box-shadow" property?
- How about "linear-gradient"?
- Have you ever used "before" and "after" in CSS?
- have you heard of making a double border?

### More Practice 

Both of the above questions were taken from css-tricks.com, and job searchers have encountered both questions in the past month interviewing for frontend roles. Head here to get some more practice:

## HTML/CSS + vanillaJS/jQuery

### 1) Color Swatch Changer

Create a text input box and a color swatch below it that changes color when the user types or makes changes in the input box. When you have this working, limit the color changing to happen no more than once per second. See the gif below for an example. Shoot for a maximum of 30 minutes. Shoot for <30 minutes, and make sure to choose the right tool for the job.

### 2) Memory Game

You should allow for an hour for this challenge. This challenge was given to someone to test their knowledge in a given framework (ex. React.js). This is a good test if you know you are shooting for a role using a specific framework. If you call yourself a react/angular/favoriteFramework whiz, test yourself by completing this challenge while explaining what you are doing to someone as you go. See gif below for an example in react.
